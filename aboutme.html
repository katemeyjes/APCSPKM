  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  <p>My name is Kate Meyjes. I am a sophomore at Piedmont High School and I turned 16 in November. I love to swim, read, write, travel, and go out to dinner with my friends. I have a dog named Willie and a younger brother named Jack. This summer I am going to work on a beach on the East Coast and I'm very excited.</p>
